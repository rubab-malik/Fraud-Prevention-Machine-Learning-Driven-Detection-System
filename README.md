### Can you detect fraud from customer transactions?
### Machine Learning to detect transaction fraud using the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection

### Introduction

The [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview) was held on Kaggle during 2019 and focused on benchmarking Machine Learning models on a large-scale transaction dataset. The task was a binary classification task: classify an online transaction as `fraud` or `not fraud` .

We decided to explore this dataset and build models to detect online fraud. Our Random Forest model was able to reach a value of `0.995` on the cleaned dataset.
